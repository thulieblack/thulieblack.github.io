My passion for open-source has led me to become a leader and expand my skills. With a blend of technical and communication expertise, I love creating sustainable solutions for communities.

Apart from my role as a Senior Community Manager at AsyncAPI Initiative, I am a member of the Technical Steering Committee, and I organize the AsyncAPI Conf and chair the Working Group, which enables me to bring together enthusiasts and experts to share insights and foster collaboration.

As a community builder, I also have the privilege of being a Mentor and project maintainer, while also focusing on developing educational content.

âš¡ The future is open source, and companies, users, and orgs need to invest in and support open-source projects and maintainers. By providing funding, we can ensure the growth and sustainability of open-source projects, paving the way for a more collaborative and innovative future.
