Many of us began our open source journey by fixing a typo, fixing a bug, improving documentation, or adding a feature. That one merged pull request marked the start of our contributions to open source.

But what happens after you become a regular contributor to that project? If you are someone who strives to grow in every situation, you’ll soon realize that being a regular contributor is just the beginning and often not enough. There is much more to open source; it is an entire world of learning, ownership, and leadership.

> **Disclaimer**: If you’re one of those who are tired of just being a regular contributor and looking to go beyond just contributions, then this article is for you. It’s not a guide, but it highlights what lies beyond contributions, how to embrace maintainership, learning in public, and personal growth.

## Curiosity as a Compass

Curiosity is often an underrated attribute to have, and yet it can be a catalyst for growth. It's easy to fall into the habit of waiting for specific tasks to be assigned to you or for "good first issues" that have a clear scope and are easy to tackle.

True growth begins when you cultivate a mindset that seeks to understand the "why" behind your contributions. Consider asking yourself questions that challenge your knowledge, such as:

- What problem is this pull request (PR) trying to solve, and what challenges does this project aim to address?
- How do maintainers determine which features are needed for this project?
- How can I improve the user or onboarding experience?
- What are the current best practices for maintenance and project management?
- Where are the unnoticed gaps that need attention?

Each question sparks a new opportunity. Allowing yourself to be curious about how things are and how they can be improved can inspire you to take the initiative beyond your assigned tasks and begin making broader, innovative contributions.

## Learning in Public

While contributions and mentorship programs are important aspects of open source, they are not the only paths to involvement. Often, after completing a program, participants may feel stuck, unsure of what to do next, and might end up moving on to another program. However, many successful maintainers did not rely solely on structured programs for their growth; they thrived by learning in public.

Here are some pathways I took to elevate my presence in the project and further my growth and learning. These are not the only options available, but they are practices I still use in my learning journey that you might consider exploring:

1. **Participate in Community Meetings and Discussions:** Many projects have various communication forums. Utilize these spaces to increase your visibility. Engage in discussions, share your insights, and learn from others. Such involvement can offer unique perspectives and foster relationships that create additional learning opportunities.

2. **Volunteer:** Volunteering without expectations often leads to unexpected results. Even small contributions can provide valuable experiences you wouldn’t have gained otherwise. For example, my journey in community building began after I hosted a few sessions at an AsyncAPI Online Conference. This experience was new for me and encouraged me to get more involved, helping me establish my presence not just through writing documentation but also through active participation in other community activities.

3. **Drive Project Initiatives:** Similar to volunteering, identify areas where the project could improve or expand. Look for opportunities to take the lead, such as becoming a release coordinator or champion. Taking on such initiatives positions you as an essential team member and helps cultivate your leadership skills.

4. **Learn in Public:** Sharing your learning journey with others not only fosters your growth but also inspires and educates those around you. Being transparent about your challenges and discoveries can create a ripple effect, attracting more contributors and solidifying your role as a knowledgeable resource in the community. You can do this through writing blog posts, creating tutorials, or giving talks at meetups or conferences.

5. **Seek, Don’t Just Wait for Mentorship:** While mentorship programs can provide valuable guidance, don’t rely solely on formal arrangements. Approach community members whose work you admire and ask for advice. Forming connections based on shared interests can lead to organic mentorship and foster collaborations that accelerate your growth.

By taking these steps, you position yourself as a resource, not just a participant. You'll be surprised at how much faster you grow when your learning is visible.

## The Leap to Maintainership

The greatest shift starts when you decide to move beyond being a regular contributor and aim to become a maintainer. That's when curiosity meets responsibility. Instead of waiting to be assigned tasks, you start creating issues, reviewing your peers' work, and learning how to properly triage tasks within a project.

You get to contribute to shaping the direction of the project, onboard other new contributors, collaborate, and actually gain experience on how to work in a distributed environment, and also foster innovation.

Making such a decision and leap will also challenge your thinking, help you view things from a different perspective. It cultivates a mindset focused on sustainability and long-term success.

Ultimately, growth in open source is not linear; it is a cycle of curiosity, experimentation, ownership, and responsibility. Every interaction and effort counts. Your unique perspective is valuable, and a whole world awaits you to explore beyond regular contributions.

Fuel your passion with curiosity, and let it take you further than you ever imagined. Get out there, explore, and let your journey inspire others too!
